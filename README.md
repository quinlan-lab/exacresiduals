#To get residual files here use branch test:

Use https://github.com/quinlan-lab/exacresiduals/tree/test (branch test is the most up-to-date)

Folder located at: /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/u1021864/analysis/exacresiduals ("exacresiduals")

##Under the folder "exacresiduals":

The folder "regions" is where the script "regions.sh" in the folder "exacresiduals" stores the "topresid.txt" and "midresid.txt" files for Monte Carlo analysis. At one point we were trying to create a gene based mean score for residuals and those are stored in there for now as well.
