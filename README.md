This is the repository for generating the CCR model.  Running `bash sbatch.sh` as is on the kingspeak cluster will generate the version of the model used in the paper.  More details and origins for data will be added soon.
This folder should be stored in the analysis folder created by the regionanalysis (https://github.com/quinlan-lab/regionanalysis) repo for now.  In the future, I will most likely merge the two repositories into one.
